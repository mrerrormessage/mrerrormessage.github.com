Hey everyone, it's been a while!

I know it's been about three years since I last wrote here.
Suffice it to say that a lot has changed.

At the time I last wrote I was programming almost exclusively in Ruby, although I also did some iOS here and there.
I've moved on to a different job at Northwestern University's Center for Connected Learning (CCL) where I program primarily in Scala, although I also get my hands dirty with a little Java when I need to hack on some of our older code.
I'm hoping to share insights from what I do at work.
I don't really have any active side projects right now, largely due to my inability to stick to something long enough to make a sizable dent in the problem.
So this blog will largely be about Scala and the Scala ecosystem, although I don't make any promises regarding what other subjects we might dive into along the way.

So stay tuned for more posts!
